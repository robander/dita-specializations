# DITA Specializations

This directory contains the Relax NG and DTD versions of modules that were
part of DITA 1.3, but are not part of the DITA 2.0 specification.

These specializations are removed from DITA 2.0 for one of the following reasons:

1. The OASIS DITA Technical Committee does not have someone with industry expertise and time to maintain the grammar files as a specification level.
1. Overall lack of use by the DITA community.

Although they are not part of the DITA 2.0 specification, the intent is to bring each of these up to date with DITA 2.0 so that they
remain compatible and can be used in DITA 2.0 environments.
